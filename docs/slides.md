## Core Concept

- **Attack Prompts (Red):** Attempt to reveal a secret key.
- **Defense Prompts (Blue):** Safeguard the secret key while maintaining a helpful response.
- **Single-Turn Battles:** One-shot interaction between attack and defense prompts determines the winner.
- **ELO Rating:** Dynamic ranking system to measure prompt effectiveness.

## Battle Mechanics
**Flow:**
1. **Setup:** Defender prompt + secret key generated.
2. **Execution:** An execution agent runs Attacker prompt vs. Defender prompt in a single-turn conversation

    ~~~python
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": get_defense_prompt(defense_prompt, secret)},
            {"role": "user", "content": attack_prompt},
        ]
    ~~~

3. **Evaluation:** An eval agent checks the response if the secret key is revealed.

## Battle Mechanics

**Outcome:**
- Attack wins if key is found in response.
- Defense wins if key remains hidden.
- Ratings are updated accordingly.

---

## Leaderboard & Rankings

**Leaderboard Categories:**
1. **Attack Rankings (Red)**: Effectiveness at extracting keys.
2. **Defense Rankings (Blue)**: Ability to protect the key.
3. **Player Rankings:** Sum of top attack & defense ratings.

**Key Metrics:**
- Rating (ELO-based)
- Win Rate
- Number of Battles

---


## ELO Rating System

**Rating Principles:**
- **Start:** 1200 rating
- **K-Factor:** 32 (64 for provisional)
- **Provisional:** First 10 battles
- **Bounds:** 100 to 3000

**Formula:**
```
New Rating = Old Rating + K * (Actual - Expected)
Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent - Player)/400))
```

---

## Rating Dynamics

- **Stronger vs. Weaker:** Small gains for stronger winner.
- **Upsets:** Low-rated prompt beating a higher-rated prompt gains up to ~32 points.
- **Equal Match:** Winner/loser exchange ~16 points.

**Result:** Ratings evolve to reflect true skill level over time.

        {"role": "user", "content": attack_prompt},
    ]
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
